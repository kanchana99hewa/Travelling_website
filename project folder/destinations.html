                            <p>Hikkaduwa beach is reputed as the second best surfing spot in 
                                Sri Lanka.This Hikkaduwa Coral Sanctuary is located a few hundred
                                 metres offshore. The sanctuary has approximately seventy varieties 
                                 of multi-coloured corals.Hikkaduwa is one of the best surfing spots in
                                  Sri Lanka, offering a clear hot water base. The waves vary in size 
                                  from 4 to 11 feet. Surfing in the Hikkaduwa area is fairly well known
                                   and gets the best surfing during its dry season, which is from 
                                   November to March. There are 4 hotspots in Hikkaduwa. Scuba diving 
                                   and diving in clear waters are a major past time along this stretch 
                                   and is the most ecological way to see the colorful fish that dart 
                                   around. The coral sanctuary along the coast of Hikkaduwa is a large 
                                   shallow body of water surrounded by a reef, decorated with layers of multicolored corals, 
                                   and is home to countless colorful fish. Off the beach there is a collection of small islets

                            <h3>Knuckles Mountain Range</h3>
                            <p>The Knuckles Mountain Range lies in central Sri Lanka, in the Districts
                                 of Matale and Kandy. The range takes its name from a series of recumbent
                                  folds and peaks in the west of the massif which resemble the knuckles of 
                                  clenched fist when viewed from certain locations in the Kandy District. Whilst
                                   this name was assigned by early British surveyors, the Sinhalese residents have
                                    traditionally referred to the area as Dumbara Kanduvetiya meaning Mist-laden Mountain 
                                    Range.The higher montane area is often robed in thick layers of cloud. In addition to 
                                    its aesthetic value, the range is of great scientific interest. It is a climatic
                                     microcosm of the rest of Sri Lanka as the conditions of all the climatic zones in
                                      the country are exhibited in the massif. At higher elevations there is a series of
                                       isolated cloud forests, harbouring a variety of flora and fauna. Although the range
                                        constitutes approximately 0.03% of the island's total area, it is home to a 
                                        significantly higher proportion of the country's biodiversity.<br><br>
